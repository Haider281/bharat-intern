                <h3>Fruit Disease Detection And Fertilizer 
                    Recommendation</h3>
                <p>Implemented fruit disease detection and fertilizer recommendation system
                    - Developed a CNN model and utilized image preprocessing techniques
                    - Utilized TF service to provide accurate results
                    - Successfully provided fertilizers and pesticides for detecting specific fruit diseases
                    - Planned future enhancements to add more fruits and crates based on user suggestions and reviews
                    - Potential for the project to scale and achieve success with correct implementations</p>

                <h3>Smart and Secure(SS) CCTV</h3>
                <p>• Main objective of the project is use in many areas such as security of the assets,
                    houses, colleges and many more.
                    • One of the CCTV surveillance objective, perceived at the majority of levels, was
                    creating a safe environment. CCTV surveillance was perceived by all levels as a
                    method to protect assets, with all levels in general agreement. The operational
                    level considered CCTV as a method of “keeping a close eye on the important
                    stuff"</p>
